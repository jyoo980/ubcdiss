\subsection{Participant Recruitment}

\noindent We tweeted the survey to a combined audience of over 2000
accounts at the time of distribution.
In addition to Twitter, the survey was distributed using mailing lists to
professional software developers.

\par As our tool relies heavily on static program information, we excluded
respondents who have never used a statically-typed language as their primary
development language. 
We also excluded individuals who do not write code at least once a month,
as they may not be the primary audience for our tool.
