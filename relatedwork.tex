\noindent Researchers have investigated both the questions that developers ask 
as they understand and evolve their systems, as well as the efficacy of tools 
that support developers in answering their questions during software change 
tasks.

\par Developers find it challenging to understand code in modern codebases for
a number of reasons.
Many codebases today are large and complex, with some meeting the definition of 
an \emph{ultra-large-scale system} \cite{feiler-2006-ulss}.

\par Google reported in 2016 that its monolithic software codebase was composed
of approximately 1 billion files, with a history of 35 million commits in a
repository that contains 85 terabytes of data and 2 billion lines of code
\cite{potvin-2016-google}.
Of course, not all software systems in existence today are quite comparable in 
scale, but it serves to contextualize the challenges that developers may face in
understanding the systems they wrangle each day.
The size, complexity, and indirection that is becoming commonplace in systems
today \cite{latoza-2010-reach} are pushing the already-elusive goal of
enabling developers to more easily enderstand their code into new and 
uncharted territories.

\par However, this is not an impossible goal.
